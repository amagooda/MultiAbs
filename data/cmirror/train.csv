"The visual represntation is hard to reproduce and understan at first sigbt Flow charts I 'm confused on why there are two paired programming problems when we do n't have class Thursday and then it follows spring break i needed more info on everything i screwed up on the exam If statements Nothing currently How to use if statements and while loops . Decision structures . the exam problem 3 Nothing Starting flow charts The blood monitor question Flowchart from PS09 PS09 I 'm afraid of the rest of the problem set because I will not be able to ask questions on Thursday sst values were confusing at times the flowchart on problem set eight was a bit confusing , especially the function terminatinon ( end ) part we learned about the error function - Nothing actually , part 1 of ps 09 slightly The tedious attention that the exam required was not a reflection of the knowledge learned in the class . it was more of a test on how well you can identify inconsistencies and how fast you can do so some of the questions can be quite tricky . Problem 3 on the exam . Nothing one of the questions on the exam had multiple answers . it was confusing us to no end I did n't understand error statements how to create the test cases The use of if else statements The most confusing thing in class was to figure out how to use the if and else statements correctly . Creating flowchart was confusing . I wished we had more time to accomplish the paired proramming assignnents before break started . some parts of the exam and flowchart The first part of the fourth test question about what to input into the code . Exam question with udfs What medium we had to make the flowcharts on . Flowcharts were somewhat confusing at first , but I think I 'm starting to understand Nothing much was confusing this week , apart from whether the answers that we have input was valid or not life is dull . nothing needed explaining , except maybe confirming the allowance of if statements We did n't go over flowcharts that much in class today . Why I received the score I did . Determing the flowchart values . Hyder was on time ! the exam and how bad I am at following variables through a function New topic about flowcharts flowcharts were boring , kinda convoluted I found the function problem on the test pretty confusing where the variables get changed up PS09 and also PS08 was confusing as well , it would be better if the problem sets would be written in better and more clear words . I 'm not a fan of the due date Logical operators Flow charts in MATLAB wording on the exam was jumbled and hard to understand a summary power point slide on if statements for this problem set would be helpful None Knowing which symbols go with which kind of output in the flow chart Although flowcharts make sense , it is hard to know if my function works properly Taking exam again revisit exam Flow charts Parts of test The monitor questions Flowchart shapes . Understanding what the problem set is asking us to do The exam was hard I did n't like it Part C of question 3 on the test I found the exam question regarding creating a CDP confusing Translating a flow chart to MATLAB is still difficult PS09 Certain concepts on the exam could use some reexplaining The error testing seems repetitive and somewhat unnecessary Flowcharting I was confused about how many variables would be in the workspace .","Mostly , students struggled with certain aspects of flowcharts , parts of the exam , or nothing at all during this lecture . Few found the problem set and if/else statements challenging ."
"The CATME team member effectiveness quiz . Not really applicable for this class session changing the time from clock to decimal for the PS 03 problem 1 I think that the conversion of clock time to decimal time could use more explaining . Liked the challenge though . Some of the questions on the quiz were pretty hard , and I do n't understand why the answer is what it is . manipulating sunset and sunrise times The quiz needed more details to solve Getting the time decimal correct for matlab code The fix function was very confusing finding out which functions to use was confusing . Coding for the decimal hours cvsread still creates some syntax issues for me . Getting used to coding takes time The fix command was confusing when written on the board , a better explanation was needed to convey the use of the command Subplots Converting the number value of time to total hours with a decimal value of partial hours was difficult but the hint on the board helped a lot . Calculating daylight hours was complicated Fix command Going from hh/mm to decimal time The fix command The most confusing thing in class today was to convert clock time into decimal time in matlab . how to convert time into decimals Lots of homework The quiz over the teamworkig skills and rubric seemed subjective . It was difficult to tell what answers the quiz wanted , and it was hard to differentiate a 3 from a 5 . converting from hours to decimals for the first 10 mins Using the fix command to convert this value into decimal hours . How to find the decimal for days It was somewhat confusing trying to figure out how to convert the daylight hours from the problem set . Learning how to convert time clock into hours was pretty confusing . Learning how to express time in different forms not really confusing but requires a lot of thinking to try and do it Where to find the wxyz letter . What is expected from us for assignments ; how much detail , etc. . I was a little confused on how to use the different matlab commands At first some of the Matlab coding was a little tricky . Seemed straight forward today . Typing the long mathematical equation commands in Matlab Fix and round function use Instructions on coding the hours learning new functions What was confusing was how to calculate the total daytime for the data set . However , after finding certain functions and using them to do the process , it did n't turn out to be that difficult . The problem set Manipulating the matrices was somewhat difficult Using new functions in MATLAB that are tough the most confusing part of today was figuring out how to convert the daylight hours into decimal hours paired programming and converting time into decimal format How to convert the time to decimal time The fix command Nothing . Using the functions with large data sets It was hard using fix functions . too many variables needed The most confusing thing was that calculating using fix command . How to convert the hours to decimals Had some issues with problem 1 converting the time to decimal hours in matlab New use of functions in MATLAB . Understanding how to convert clock time to decimal time in matlab Class went smoothly today it was confusing determining what functions were allowed and what were not How to utilize functions to make an efficient code Converting times to decimal hours was very confusing and complex , and we were n't able to figure it out without help Knowing where to use the fix function . I thought that the first question on the problem set was fairly confusing . Professor Hynes did his best to explain what we were supposed to do to solve the problem but didnt give us the exact answer which meant that we had to work a bit harder to find the solution . Nothing was very confusing today . Once I understood the conversion it was simple . I still struggle with MatLab but it 's getting better . I think there needed to be more information about the function needed to be used in the first step of Problem 1 Everything was clear","The responses indicate that converting time in decimals to hours was the most challenging part of this class session . The rest of the class found the fix function , functions in general , and the effectiveness quiz challenging . Additionally , a good amount of the class found nothing challenging ."

"Traversing through trees recursively Packages the benefits for the different ways of traversing the trees nothing , everything was pretty straightforward code for bsts In order tracing Can a binary search tree be made using a different method of iterating through the tree ? Search tree interface Why might duplicates be problematic ? Nothing was really confusing this lecture . Search Tree Interface Binary Search Trees None Everything was pretty clear . I had no real questions . Nothing was difficult Some of the operations","Most of the students had no problems with the lecture .

"it was a smoooth class nothing nothing the change in the direction of inequalities confused me . the probabilities on both sides of the chi squared distribution equaling a/2 was a bit confusing F distribution projection The use of the F distribution ( why it is sigma-2-square * S-1-square / ( sigma-1-square * S-2-square ) and not sigma-2-square * S-2-square / ( sigma-1-square * S-1-square ) ) none for now determining the dofs of F Interval estimating Everything is clear Standard error Nothing Nothing at all variance interval confidence interval on proportion of the variances of two populations .  F distribution When finding variance confidence level , degrees of freedom was confusing . everything was clear Nothing the intervals differences between chisquare and f Nothing Nothing f distribution usage in estimation Everything was clear Still do n't feel 100 % about point estimates when they are mentioned","The source of small confusion was from the usage and derivation of the F distribution , the confidence level of variance , the chi square distribution , and how the degrees of freedom were found in the F distribution ."
"UDFs I do n't know how to . All functions or how to make the variables all work . It 's kinda frustrating because we have the time to get the assignment done but I do n't know what to do and I feel like I 'm so close to getting it right . Nothing was all that difficult to understand How to determine the settings for a function . Udfs This class was straight forward not very confusing Using sub functions can be difficult when it comes to keeping track of variables . Class today was very clear Learning where the variables were defined i.e locally or in workspace Problem 2 executive function User-defined functions How to assign each variable in the vector in the user defined functions Set input parameters as one vector for input The user defined function is still very unclear to me . With no prior coding experience I am having difficulties with making this complex function . Starting out with simpler functions , or having more complex examples to work through at the beginning of class would be helpful course standards for using UDFs Coding Putting the two udfs together confused me and I will need to spend time this weekend to figure out how the two functions play off each other . It was difficult getting the math to work in someone else 's code when there are many issues with parentheses that are n't obvious the most confusing part of today 's class was passing in the input arguments to each UDF correctly . Waiting for the other pair to finish commenting How to write UDF 's The most confusing thing about class was how to format the function so it works perfectly . Running executive function . Some details in the first code How to do executive functions : besides being called a function what differentiates it from scripts Nothing really . Everything kind of made sense today . I thought that it was relatively confusing trying to create the codes for the equations from the problem set . Dealing with multiple UDF 's may sometimes be confusing , especially when working in a classroom environments . nothing confusing for me . pretty straightforward Problem 1 Parts of the problem were very confusing . Why the homework takes me so much time . Nothing The proper syntax for how functions should be written so they can be called by other functions . the problem sheet was somewhat vague Nothing was that confusing today what was confusing was printing both setting 1 and 2 Calling the functions and making sure that the output matches Doing executive functions UDF 's in general and how they work more explanation on how a UDF gets inputs and how it produces outputs Nothing Function calls None Linking the data from the executive file to the individual functions as I understood the features of udf well , today 's class was not confusing Using user defined function and solving problems It is tedious to write those programme None Executive function Calling functions and variable names within functions . Most things were fairly straight forward Making the the two sub UDFs fit together perfectly took some time & was difficult Creating and using functions . MATLAB . UDF Dealing with user defined functions could be confusing at times . More details about the functions from the instructors would be appreciated . There was no confusion today I 'm very confused about matlab and clearly am behind other students , I am not sure how I lack the knowledge but UDF confuses me Nothing was confusing just trying to fix the code was frustrating . How UDF works and how you can call many functions in a new function The instructions given for problem 2 in problem set 5 were a bit confusing .","Mostly , students struggled creating user defined functions , calling functions within other functions , and running executive functions . They also found handling variables challenging . Some students did n't find anything challenging at all ."
"The appropiate structure to use functions UDFs Switching the UDF file to Nino and io is confusing cause I do n't understand why we need to do that yet as well as it says to copy over the relevant information but since we are learning to use the user functions I do n't know what is relevant Histograms and matrix manipulation . some of the specifics involved with the function syntax Proceeding in problem 2 on PS04 Using some of the plot functions was tricky at times . I 'm not good wt all of them . The first part of problem 2 of problem set # 4 the use of udfs UDF too lit to handle Nothing was confusing today ! Understanding how to make the user defined functions was confusing and the lecture helped but I still have questions . Writing a Program with inputs and outputs was confusing Publishing a function because I do n't understand what part 8 is asking Use of functions Built in Functions I thought the entirety of ps04 problem 4 was atrociously confusing in all ways . I am still a little bit confused with how the function script works , but it can be easily resolved with practice . Everything was fine . UDF 's are very confusing and hard to understand still do n't get some of the fundamentals of UDFs What was expceted for nino Initializing and executing the functions was confusing Confusing thing was that there was not enough information User defined functions Function declaration . Why we made a function that has no inputs or outputs that 's kinda useless How to manipulate the items to make a script file The directions for seething up UDF seemed very vague and did n't make sense in class .","The students found user defined functions and functions in general to be the most challenging . Additionally , they struggled with the problem set , inputs and outputs , and the uses of nino ."

"The flowcharts , it is hard for me to follow the logic PS10 Problem 1 The templates are generic templates so there is a section that we did n't have to fill out but we were not told that until we asked about it The function itself is a little bit confusing since there 's multiple inputs and outputs When you ca n't use `` if '' instead of `` while '' or vice versa The exam grades in class and why things were graded the way they are .
