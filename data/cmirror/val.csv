"divide and conquer Recursion being applied to things we already have looked at and comparing how it affects the iterations . Also divide and conquer making recursion have less iterations is interesting . it will be more interesting to compare run-times 1 vs 2 recursive calls in a recursive method I 've never heard of divide and conquer before ! Divide and Conquer recustion Seeing how much more efficient the divide and conquer power method was versus the original method why sequential search through recursion is slower than binary search through recursion efficiency of divide and conquer The number of multiplications that each method of recursion yields How dividing and conquering works recursion with bubble sort concepts The divide and conquer for X ^ N and its efficiency Divide and Conquer method Divide in conquer as an efficient way to recurse I thought it was interesting finding actual cases of recursion being the most efficient method RECURSION :D I found the visuals and accompanying drawings the most interesting . The recursive case for the power function The differentiation between ( x ^ / ( n/2 ) ) ^ 2 and multiplying ( x ^ ( n/2 ) ) * ( x ^ ( n/2 ) ) was pretty interesting today . binary search in recursion Recursion via divide and conquer Divide and Conquer The idea of ` dividing and conquering , ' and it 's runtime comparison to general recursive methods","The students were interested in applying the divide and conquer method to recursive methods . They noted the comparison of efficiency between different recursive techniques , and cited specific examples of using recursion , such as in the computation of powers and in binary search ."

"visualization of linked bags on the board is really interesting and helpful for understanding nodes . How to manipulate a bag of nodes how to remove an item from a linked list Nodes in linked lists are n't necessarily permanently tied to the data they point to . I liked the points about the linked bag The way nodes are set up and used in a linked list . adding to the linked bag The order of the node does n't matter , and the removal methods . The different methods associated with the linkedbag How you can navigate around a set of nodes . Learning about the methods used to modify linked bags . The adding and removing of a linked bag Adding a node to a linked list occurs at the start of the list because it is much easier than adding to the end . Adding an element to a linked list occurs at the start of the list since it is much easier than the end . Some object-oriented purists believe it is better to never ` violate ' the private nature of a class ' data . I found linked lists to be the most interesting point of the lecture . Seeing how they differ from the bag and in what circumstances they are useful . I thought the different ways to implement the Node class itself were interesting , especially because it helps show the divide between simplicity of code and adaptability of its functionality ( private inner class VS public outer ) linkedbags Since last lecture , we have been trying to find more efficient ways of making useable ` arrays . ' I find this helpful because , even though the new 2x array is not too difficult ( we used it in my last CS 401 assignment last semester ) , I was wondering if there were better ways to implement ` resizable ' arrays . So , learning about linked list today may be helpful for more manageable array-included tasks in the future . I found the topics we discussed in class today the most interesting . Linked bag ! lists vs bags The list follows a pattern for adding entries that is opposite to a bag . Learning about the Linked List Implimentation of linked lists in bags The concept of the linked list is n't something that really has a real world parallel , so to learn about it and its implementation was interesting . I liked talking about the bag . I definitely thought the adding to the front was an important point to make -- as opposed to arrays adding in the back .","Most of the students found something related to linked bags most interesting this lecture . Specifically , some students mentioned the methods used for adding/removing elements from a linked bag and the differences between linked bags and lists ."
"Exam review Being able to work on M2 and PS11b in class was great . This has been cramped and rough week for me so being able to relax a little bit and get it done in class was great Learning how to go through code when the deadline is right around the corner . Revising for Exam 3 Exam review The difference of while loops and for loops and when to use them practicing the any and all commands for Matlab was interesting complex , or nested loops Milestone 2 Nested for loopes were more clear when explained by professor hynes , unfortunately I still do not find them particularly clear , but it is definitely better than before This class was very helpful because we had a strong understanding of the milestone and we had the TAs help in finishing our M2 . Nothing Review The revision for exam 3 was very helpful Exam 3 review was very helpful . Exam review finishing up milestone 2 and reviewing for exam Knowing all the LOs we need to do We were mostly allowed to complete our final problem set for ENGR 132 and our milestone . That aside , we were given an exam review for our final exam in ENGR 132 I found the review very helpful . It was interesting that this class is only 2 credits but is more work than any other class . The length of M3 I found it interesting how close our algorithms were The milestone is interesting The exam review The exam review Reviewing for test 3 reviewing logical statements was very helful Modifying M2 and PS11b Test practice Review and the extra time to ask questions about M2 Exam review Finishing up M2 Reviewing for exam 2 , refreshing on logical operators The exam review given by the professor was the most interesting because it was very informative i found the exam review helpful because i didnt know that the find function looks at columns before rows unlike the any and all functions .","Mostly , students found the exam review very interesting . They also enjoyed working on milestone 2 , reviewing nested loops , and completing the final problem set ."
"iterators and their uses I found analyzing linked lists in regards to runtime to be interesting applying sorting algorithms to list ADTs makes them feel more significant Mergesort in a Llist iterators through a linked list iterators are good because they can be used for all different kinds of objects Today we learned about the iterator interface and how it could be used to make iterating through lists/arrays more efficient . I found the diagrams that were drawn on the board the most interesting . Iterators The concept of iterators was really interesting today , especially their usage . Internal vs. external version of iteration iterarors I was a bit preoccupied today but seeing merge sort and quick sort show the relative ordering concept . how typically iterating through a linked list can be very inefficient The implementation of iterators Iterators and their effectiveness How iterators can be used . quick sort and merge sort The idea of being able to iterate through a lot of different data structures","Students were interested by the concept of the iterator , and how it can be applied to lists , as well as other data structures . They again noted sorted algorithms , as well as analyses of runtime and efficiency of algorithms ."
