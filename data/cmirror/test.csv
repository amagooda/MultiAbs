The recursive tree touched on at the end of class in the tower of hanoi problem . Recursion , recursion , and more recursion The towers of hanoi problem can be solved in 4 lines of code ! The towers recursion problem I think all of the potential applications of backtracking are very interesting Recursion problems I found the examples the most interesting and the way that our professor explained the examples was interesting as well . I loved the interactive game that you had students play . That 's a great idea for the classroom ! towers Hanoi Towers of Hanoi w / backtracking Hanoi towers - interesting to see how many recursions are required to solve an increasing amount of levels towers of hanoi Backtracking 's usefulness is truly great ; recursion is beautiful Today was pretty interesting .

"The differnets graphs and their interaction in with log How logs work I found it interesting how we can use this log process to find out what the graphs equation is and solve figuring out which axis to take the log of Linearizing data , since we learned something similar to that in chemistry New commands for matlab involving logarithms How to calculate the least squares regression model for data . the math involved in graphs How to use logarithmic scales learning how to take data and turn it into a line Learning how to generate linear graphs from non-linear equations Linearization of data the conflicts mentioned at the beginning of class were interesting linear modeling was Individual problems The activities , helped us to understand what was going on Function discovery Today the majority of class was spent on XA activities . I did not find these very helpful because they are not very similar to the matlab PS converting exponential functions into linear models Suptitle and it 's non existence Nothing really stood out to me today in class . How to find the regression line in MATLAB Using the log functions to find linear projections was interesting to figure out how we can make non linear plots linear . The most interesting thing was the matlab set up Nothing . It was very tedious The most interesting part of today 's class was how to manipulate a graph to make it linear Working in pairs learning how to lineraization Handwriting the graphs Linearization of data and determining what kind of function the data is for as well as the equation for the data The most interesting thing in class was function discovery because it was something I had never done before . Linearization of data Problem set I enjoyed the different approach to teaching the material . Using worksheets was helpful to understanding the material . different types of equations Plot the raw data using log scales makes a linear line How you can rewrite nonlinear graphs into linear ones and have them convey the same information effectively The professor taught us the different types of curves and how to linearize the graphs . Additionally , we were given assignments from XA activities which helped me understand the subject matter better . The relationship between data and logs doing the linearization Linearizing data How there are several different ways to graph the same function . I was interested in how we could linearize data that is not normally straight . I liked learning about the function discovery . Linearization The log log command Semilogx and semilogy calls Linearizing data for different kinds of functions Commands for the graphs doing the linearization plots Making the data linear I found it interesting that MATLAB makes it so easy to plot graphs with log based scales on the axes The different plots for logarithms is interesting I have n't used paper since high school . So that was different Creating logarithmic graphs ways to linearize data Learning linearized data The function discovery was pretty interesting Learning how to use the log scales to linearize data trying to find linear fit Function discovery was interesting . i learned how to represent data differently Different kinds of graphs find the best fit equation for a dataset Linearization Learning about functions Figuring out which plots make a graph linear Learning how to linearize How we can linearlize datasets was pretty cool Learning I can use magenta in the graphs . I found it interesting how you could manipulate the the axes of a graph to make it linear How useless what i have learned in the past must be . New functions in naming plots Practicing plotting on paper before doing it in matlab How a log graph works is pretty cool and pretty interesting I found using matlab to plot and find the slope and y intercept of the data given to be interesting . How linearization works I enjoyed creating the lines by hand in class because it was hands on . Ploting logx and logy","The students found linearizing data and using logs/logarithmic scales to be the most interesting part of lecture . Next , they found function discovery , handwriting graphs , and the commands for linearization equally interesting ."

"Packages were interesting , and how you can group together various classes and import them through the package BST 's the different ways to traverse the trees the funny sound effects that Ramirez made bst 's Binary Search Trees Binary search trees Tree traversal types The binary search tree , and why duplicates might be problematic I guess the different types of traversals for binary trees . Copying a tree Tree Transversing Binary trees Binary Search Trees are pretty cool . They show how trees can be useful . Nothing stood out today All the recursion in binary trees","Most of the students found Binary Search Trees and tree traversal as interesting . Some others liked packages , copying a tree and problems with duplicates ."
"Nothing Mean square error Mean square error f distribution Nice summary of f distribution , estimators , biased and unbiased estimators . Mean squared error and mean absolute deviation Bias ps Finding the deviation btw population mean and sample mean using Î˜ . repeating last course about compairing mean and variances from different resources Mean square error mean square error Bias Mean square errors Sample estimation f distribution Mean square errors Nothing errors f distribution mean square error Mean square error Main Square Error Mean Mean square error Point of interest nothing reliability errors Nothing Sixth question in exam Mean square error Variance and bias are explained thoroughly . use of f distribution Point estination Bias of an estimator Mean Square Error Mean square error Mean square error F distribution recap",Almost half of students found mean square error most interesting . A handful enjoyed F-distributions or nothing . A few students mentioned liking the recap of previous concepts covered and bias -LRB- of an estimator -RRB- .
"trees are the most interesting data structure so far , in my opinion . Recursively getting the height of a binary tree implementing trees in java to store data how to find the height of a binary tree recursively not much was interesting binary tree lengths Binary trees binary tree recursion Lecture felt a little long today though we got out earlier . Nothing struck me as particularly interesting . Binary Tree nodes The entire binary trees discussion Binary trees and how we can traverse them via recursion The height of a tree is found by calling max ( hL , hR ) +1 Recursive processing of binary trees",Most of the students found binary trees and finding the height through recursion as interesting . Some of them did n't find anything interesting in the lecture .
